Use openssl to create server and client keys + certs.

For the server key+cert, perform:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout techtem_server_key.pem -out techtem_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

For the client key+cert, perform:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout techtem_client_key.pem -out techtem_cert_client.pem -days 365 -nodes


For servers and clients to work:
Servers must have the following in their certification directory:

	techtem_server_key.pem
	techtem_cert.pem
	techtem_cert_client.pem

Clients must have the following in their certification directory:

	techtem_cert.pem
	techtem_client_key.pem
	techtem_cert_client.pem

Do not include server's key in clients, and try to avoid including
the clients' keys in servers.


The meanings of some values of the openssl commands:
	- rsa:4096 is the size of the key in bits. Feel free to make it
	  smaller (ie 2048), but it's less cool
	- 365 specifies how long the certificate will be valid for.
	  Replace it after it expires though.
